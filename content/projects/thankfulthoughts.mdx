ThankfulThoughts is a web application that allows users to input a person, place, or thing, and generates a sentence of gratitude in return. It's a simple yet powerful tool to help users express gratitude and positive thoughts towards the things they are thankful for.

## How it works

This project uses the [OpenAI GPT-3 API](https://openai.com/api/) (specifically, text-davinci-003). It asks a user to select from a dropdown a person, place or thing as an input. Then asks from the name. Then sends it to the GPT-3 API  and sends the response back to the application.

## Running Locally

After cloning the repo, go to [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to make an account and put your API key in a file called `.env`.

Then, run the application in the command line and it will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
